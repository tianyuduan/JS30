          Event bubbling and capturing are ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API.
          Event Progagation determines which order the elements receive the event.

          With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.

          With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.

          Capturing is also called "trickling", which helps remember the propagation order:

          "trickle down, bubble up"

<style>
  html {
    box-sizing: border-box;

  *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; }

  div {
    width:100%;
    padding:100px;

  .one {
    background: thistle;
  }

  .two {
    background:mistyrose;

    background:coral;

<button></button>
<script>
  const divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
  // console.log(divs);

  function logText(e) {

    console.log(this); //refers to whatever is getting clicked by, ex: div class ='three'
    console.log(this.classList); //refers to the DOM token list, has value, length and 0
    console.log(this.classList.value) //calls the value, in this game, "three"
    // e.stopPropagation(); //stop bubbling

  }

  // divs.forEach(div => div.addEventListener('click', logText));

  //capture is default false, it will fire the funciton on the way down, rather than on the way up
  divs.forEach(div => div.addEventListener('click', logText, {
    capture: false,
    once: true, //listen for a click, once its clicked, it will remove itself from the event listener
  }));

  //browser does something called a capture, goes from top down
  //figures out what it needs to capture
  //then the bubbling goes from bottom up
  //firing off the click events , from three, two, then one

  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Click!!!');
  }, {
    once: true
  });
