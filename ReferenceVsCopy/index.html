    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    //deep dupe methods
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //Use object dot assign


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(capt2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread


    // const capt3 = {...person} // Not yet !
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    // object.assign is only one level deep
    //use lodash
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    //poor mans deep clone, shakes off all refernces .
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
