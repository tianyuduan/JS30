### The Pizza Value Calculator

> Is a fun, interactive calculator built to determine the best choice when deciding to purchase a small, medium and large pizza. It takes user inputs and calculates the best value per slice and/or inches squared.


> This project uses various other technologies as well, including modal display, google Charts to render a bar graph of the results, the Konami code sequence as well as HTML5 Canvas to render the confetti.
